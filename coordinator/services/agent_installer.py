"""The ONE implementation of "get the writ-agent-fleet binary onto this machine".

Two callers need that, and they used to answer it differently:

  * ``/agent.sh`` — the ``curl … | sh`` installer an operator pastes onto any
    machine. ``main.py`` serves the script this module holds.
  * ``services/local_agent.py`` — "Run one on this machine" in the Fleet connect
    modal, where the coordinator installs and supervises an agent on its OWN
    host (the ``run-local.sh`` case, i.e. most first installs).

The second one used to resolve, download and unpack the release itself, in
Python, and it had drifted from the script in every detail that decides whether
the result runs:

  * it matched RUST TARGET TRIPLES against assets that are named for their
    ``<os>-<arch>`` infix, so it matched nothing and failed naming a string that
    appears nowhere in the release;
  * it looked for an archive member called ``writ-agent``, while the fleet
    archive contains ``writ-agent-fleet``;
  * it extracted that binary ALONE, leaving behind the Playwright driver that
    ships beside it — so an agent that did start could not launch a browser.

Rather than repair a second copy, the local path now runs THIS script in
``--download-only`` mode. One asset-naming rule, one checksum verification, one
extraction, for every way an agent is installed.

The launch contract is part of the same story: ``writ-agent-fleet`` takes its
whole configuration from the ENVIRONMENT (``WRIT_SERVICE_TOKEN``,
``WRIT_COORDINATOR_URL``, ``WRIT_FLEET_ALLOW_INSECURE``) and is run bare. The
``config set`` / ``start --headless`` subcommands belong to the DESKTOP
``writ-agent`` binary and do not exist here.
