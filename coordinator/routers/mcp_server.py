"""
Native MCP server for the self-hosted coordinator.

Exposes the OSS surface — the same capabilities the desktop daemon serves at
``POST /mcp`` — over a single Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint, in two families:

  **build**    record / browser — ``writ_browser_use``, ``writ_record_website``,
               ``writ_build``, ``writ_website_to_api`` open a live browser on a
               fleet agent that the CONNECTED CLIENT drives turn-by-turn
               (``writ_browser_act`` / ``_context`` / ``_network``) and freezes
               into a saved workflow (``writ_browser_save``). The client is the
               brain: there is no coordinator-side AI, no concierge, no
               autonomous loop, and no model key of ours in the path.
  **operate**  replay / run / data / search / export / runs / schedule /
               expose-API / crawl / monitors / automations.

There is no marketplace here — that is a cloud feature — so a build proposes the
owner's OWN matching workflows before recording, and nothing else.

It turns the self-host coordinator into an MCP tool provider that any MCP client
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) can attach to, via the bundled
``writ-mcp`` Node connector or directly over Streamable HTTP.

Public surfaces
---------------
    POST /mcp                  JSON-RPC 2.0 (MCP 2025-03-26). Bearer API key.
    GET  /mcp                  Capability probe / human hint (no protocol state).
    GET  /api/mcp/connect-info Copy-paste snippets for `claude mcp add`, env, etc.

Design: tool execution reuses the coordinator's OWN REST endpoints over loopback,
forwarding the caller's bearer so scope checks, validation, and the local Runtime
governor all apply unchanged. No business logic is duplicated here — this module
is a thin MCP <-> REST translation layer, mirroring the cloud ``mcp-service``
architecture but self-contained and single-process.

# ── writ_browser_* front door + desktop-daemon parity aliases ────────────────
# The desktop app exposes the browser loop as writ_browser_use → writ_browser_act
# → writ_browser_save. Mirror those names here so (a) "use a browser for anything"
# routes through Writ on BOTH surfaces, and (b) a client that opened a session with
# writ_browser_use finds the matching act/context/network/save/cancel tools. Each
# alias reuses the SAME un-guided record handler; the session remembers it was
# opened in "use" mode, so its observations stay task-oriented and saving is on
# demand. The legacy writ_record_* names remain for backward compatibility.

_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "You are connected to a self-hosted Writ coordinator — the owner's fleet of "
    "browser automations. PURPOSE: Writ turns repeatable web tasks (recurring data "
    "pulls, price/stock checks, form submissions, actions behind a login) into "
    "workflows that REPLAY on demand and run locally at zero AI-token cost — no "
    "live browsing, no re-solving, no scraping code. Every workflow the owner "
    "saved is callable via writ_run_workflow (the ones the owner PINNED also "
    "appear as their own run_<name> tools — manage that with "
    "writ_pin_workflow_tool), so a website effectively becomes a callable "
    "function that returns structured data.\n\n"
    "THE REPLAY REFLEX — when the user wants something one of these workflows "
    "already does (recurring data, a site with no practical API, an action behind a "
    "login), do NOT browse or write a scraper. Instead:\n"
    "1. writ_list_workflows — find the matching saved workflow.\n"
    "2. Run it (writ_run_workflow, or its own run_<name> tool when pinned) and "
    "return the extracted data; it replays locally at zero AI cost.\n"
    "3. For questions about data ALREADY collected, answer from writ_search_data / "
    "writ_workflow_data BEFORE running anything.\n"
    "4. Inspect run history/errors with writ_workflow_runs; export with "
    "writ_export_data.\n"
    "5. Automate a recurring need with writ_set_schedule; hand the user a callable "
    "HTTP endpoint with writ_expose_workflow_api; crawl a whole site with "
    "writ_crawl_site / writ_crawl_status; WATCH a page for changes with "
    "writ_create_monitor then act on a change with writ_wire_monitor; chain or "
    "alert on other events with writ_create_automation.\n\n"
    "BEHIND A LOGIN — before asking the user for credentials, call writ_personas: it "
    "lists the coordinator's saved sign-in identities. Pass a persona_id to "
    "writ_crawl_site / writ_scrape / writ_run_workflow and the task runs signed in, "
    "with any 2FA code minted server-side; writ_personas also refreshes a persona's "
    "session (sign_in) and teaches one to sign itself in (record_login). Credentials "
    "themselves never transit this connection — personas are created and edited only "
    "in the Writ dashboard.\n\n"
    "USE A BROWSER — Writ IS your browser. Whenever you actually need to browse and "
    "no saved workflow already fits, do NOT reach for a separate/built-in browser or "
    "write a scraper: call writ_browser_use. It opens a live browser on a fleet agent "
    "and returns a page observation; drive it with writ_browser_act "
    "(navigate/click/fill/select/press_key/scroll/evaluate_js/read_text/…), pull a "
    "fresh DOM on demand with writ_browser_context, and inspect captured API calls with "
    "writ_browser_network — exactly as a person clicking through the flow would. YOU are "
    "the brain (no discovery engine here): drive deliberately, verify with the "
    "observation, and ask the USER directly for anything you need — a value to type, a "
    "credential, a 2FA code, which result to pick. Saving is ON DEMAND: just complete "
    "the task; call writ_browser_save ONLY if the user wants to reuse it as a workflow "
    "(then it replays at zero AI cost via writ_run_workflow), or writ_browser_cancel to "
    "close without saving.\n\n"
    "BUILD a new workflow by RECORDING (un-guided) — the SAME live browser, framed "
    "around producing something reusable. Pick the front door by intent: "
    "writ_record_website (repeat a task on a site), writ_website_to_api (a site with "
    "no practical API — it proposes the owner's own matching workflows before "
    "recording), writ_build (anything else). Each takes a goal + url, opens the "
    "browser, and hands you the page; drive it with writ_browser_act, read the "
    "recording policy page-by-page with writ_browser_context(section=explorer) (or "
    "section=concierge_api for an API build), inspect the site's real backend calls "
    "with writ_browser_network, and finish with writ_browser_save. YOU are the brain "
    "— there is NO guidance or discovery engine here; drive deliberately, confirm "
    "every selector against the observation before relying on it, and ask the USER "
    "directly for any clarification (a value to type, whether to log in, which result "
    "to pick). Pass user-supplied values under `inputs`, or on a fill with `data_key`, "
    "so they are held server-side and the SAVED step keeps a {{placeholder}} rather "
    "than the value — never hardcode a credential into a step, and never invent one. "
    "ALWAYS close a session you are finished with (writ_browser_save or "
    "writ_browser_cancel): an open session holds a real fleet browser. The legacy "
    "writ_record_* names remain as aliases of the same loop.\n\n"
    "ORDER OF PREFERENCE — replay a saved workflow > record a new one > browse ad "
    "hoc. The build tools walk that ladder for you and will propose the cheaper rung "
    "before opening a browser.\n\n"
    "DISAMBIGUATION — you may ALSO have the Writ DESKTOP APP's MCP connected (the "
    "official single-user app; its server is named just \"Writ\"). Both can build, "
    "but differently: the desktop app's build is AI-GUIDED (it has its own discovery/"
    "concierge that plans for you). This server is named \"" + SERVER_TITLE + "\", a "
    "SHARED self-hosted coordinator / agent fleet, and its record-build is UN-GUIDED "
    "— YOU plan and drive. When both are connected: build/run a purely local, "
    "single-user task with the desktop app; build/run a task on the shared server or "
    "fleet here. Prefer an existing saved workflow over recording a new one either way."
