"""One-line agent enrolment: pairing codes and the installer script.

The exchange endpoint is UNAUTHENTICATED by necessity — the machine being
enrolled holds no credential yet, so the code itself is the credential. That
makes its properties load-bearing rather than cosmetic, and each one below is a
way the feature could quietly become an open enrolment endpoint:

  * single use  — a code lifted from a shell history or a proxy log is spent
  * short TTL   — a leaked code stops working on its own
  * unguessable — 32^7 ≈ 34 billion, over a rate-limited endpoint
  * indistinguishable failures — wrong, spent and expired all answer the same,
    so the endpoint cannot be used to confirm that a code ever existed

The script served at /agent.sh is checked for the two mistakes that would make
it dangerous or dead: shipping a secret, and being shadowed by the SPA
catch-all so that `curl … | sh` pipes an HTML page into a shell.
