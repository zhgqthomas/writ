"""
Writ Self-Hosted Coordinator — Main FastAPI Application.

A single-user, single-container coordinator. It exposes the coordinator surface
(workflows, monitors, personas, runs, files, vault, agents/fleet, settings) plus
the agent wire contract (oauth device-flow, recorder_proxy, user_recorder(+ws)).

Redis is not an external dependency: a single process backs all Redis-style
usage (rate-limit, presence, dedup, agent-state, pub/sub, report/dispatch
streams) with an in-process fakeredis client (``utils.inproc_redis``) sharing
one keyspace. No Redis server is required to boot or run.

    #     widened the policy. A self-hosted product must not phone a CDN.

    #     frame-ancestors delivered in a <meta> element, so the header is the one
    #     that actually denies framing ('none', matching X-Frame-Options: DENY).
    #
    # A route that sets its OWN CSP wins — this default never overwrites it. That
    # matters for the dataset renders (`?format=html`), which echo SCRAPED
    # third-party content back from this origin and so must be served under
    # `default-src 'none'` (services/dataset_formats.py stamps it). The SPA-serving
    # policy below allows `script-src 'self'`, which would NOT block execution on
    # such a response; clobbering the route's stricter header would silently
