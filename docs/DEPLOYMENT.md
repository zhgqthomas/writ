# Production deployment

Put this coordinator on a public domain, with a real certificate, in one
command.

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh writ.example.com you@example.com
```

That is the whole thing. Point your domain's A record at the server first; the
script does the rest and tells you what it changed.

## What that command does

1. **Checks the ground.** Docker is installed and running, ports 80 and 443 are
   free, and `writ.example.com` already resolves here. The DNS check matters:
   Let's Encrypt rate-limits failed issuance, so it is cheaper to catch a missing
   record now than to burn attempts on it.
2. **Creates `.env` with fresh secrets** if you have not run `gen-env.sh` yet.
   Existing secrets are never rotated, so re-running is safe.
3. **Writes every domain-derived setting consistently.** These four used to be
   four separate things to remember, and getting any one of them wrong produced a
   coordinator that looked healthy and did not work:

   | Setting | Value | Why |
   |---|---|---|
   | `WRIT_PUBLIC_URL` | `https://writ.example.com` | agents dial it, `/agent.sh` embeds it, the Host allowlist derives from it |
   | `WRIT_DOMAIN` | `writ.example.com` | the site address Caddy requests a certificate for |
   | `CORS_ORIGINS` | `https://writ.example.com` | `*` is refused in production |
   | `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` | `127.0.0.1,172.16.0.0/12` | so per-IP limits see the real caller, not Caddy |

4. **Starts the `tls` profile**, which brings up Caddy beside the coordinator.
5. **Waits and verifies** — the coordinator's health endpoint, then the live
   `https://` URL. If the certificate does not arrive it tells you the three
   things that actually cause that (DNS, firewall, a web server already on :80).

Re-run it any time: to change domain, to repair a half-finished deploy, or after
`docker compose down`.

## Container images

The [Docker images workflow](../.github/workflows/docker.yml) builds the
coordinator (including its web UI) and doc-extract on native amd64 and arm64
runners. Publication first runs the complete CI and cross-repository E2E gate
against the exact tagged commit. Each image is started and checked: coordinator must
serve a healthy API and its built UI; doc-extract must report a ready OCR engine.
All checks and all four builds must pass before the publishing job receives
registry write permissions and loads the saved, tested images. A candidate
manifest is verified before assigning version or stable tags.

| Trigger | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Relevant changes in a PR or on `main` | Build and smoke-test both images on both architectures; no registry push |
| Push a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease]` tag | Validate CI/E2E, build, smoke-test, and publish both images to GHCR |
| Actions → Docker images → Run workflow | Build and smoke-test; select **publish** and an existing version **tag** to run all publication gates |

Published image names follow the repository owner, lowercased, so a fork publishes
to its own namespace:

- `ghcr.io/<owner>/writ-coordinator`
- `ghcr.io/<owner>/writ-doc-extract`

A `v1.2.3` tag publishes `:v1.2.3`, `:1.2.3`, and `:sha-<full commit SHA>`.
Only the highest stable version tag can advance `:latest`; the existing manifest's
version annotation also prevents a rollback if a newer Git tag was deleted.
Prerelease tags such as `v1.2.3-rc.1` never update `:latest`. A legacy `latest`
without a version annotation is preserved, with a note in the Actions summary;
confirm its version and migrate its annotation before enabling automatic promotion.
Moved or deleted release tags fail validation again immediately before publication.
Manual publication requires a version tag; an untagged branch can only be built.
Both images contain `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` in the
same manifest, so Docker selects the host's architecture automatically. The
Actions summary lists the exact published references.

The E2E gate uses `agent_repo` (default: this owner's `writ-agent`) and optional
`agent_tag`. An empty tag resolves the latest stable Agent release once, records
that exact version, and pins it for the whole test. A new fork must publish its
Agent first, or explicitly select an existing compatible Agent release. Failed
build, Compose, installer and Agent logs are saved before cleanup and uploaded
as an artifact; local runs use an isolated Compose project and temporary Agent home.

Publishing uses the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`; no extra
registry secret is needed. For anonymous pulls, make each GHCR package public
after its first publication. Existing packages must grant this repository Actions
access. The checked-in Compose configuration and `deploy.sh` continue to build
from source; using published images requires setting the corresponding service
`image` references and running Compose with `--no-build`.

To smoke-test a locally built image with the same checks as CI:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke-docker-image.sh writ-coordinator:latest coordinator
bash scripts/smoke-docker-image.sh writ-doc-extract:latest doc-extract
```

The CI test/audit environment uses the same hashed Python lockfiles as the images.
`scripts/install-ci-deps.sh` installs runtime dependencies first, then constrains
test tools to that installed set so they cannot silently replace production pins.
After editing either Python requirements input, regenerate its lock for Python 3.12
with `uv pip compile --generate-hashes --only-binary=:all:` and verify both Linux
amd64 and arm64 resolutions before committing. The coordinator frontend builds
with Node 24, matching `frontend/package.json`.

## TLS

Caddy obtains the certificate over ACME and **renews it by itself**. There is no
certbot, no renewal cron, and no reload hook to forget — the single most common
way a self-hosted deployment breaks three months later.

Certificates and the ACME account key live on the `caddy-data` volume. Back it
up with the rest of your data. Losing it is survivable — Caddy re-issues on the
next start — but Let's Encrypt allows only 5 duplicate certificates per domain
per week, so repeated loss during a rebuild loop can lock you out of issuance for
a few days.

Debugging a deploy? `--staging` switches to Let's Encrypt's staging CA, which
issues untrusted certificates but has far looser limits:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh writ.example.com you@example.com --staging
```

Re-run without the flag once it works; the script switches back automatically.

## Bring your own proxy

If you already run nginx, Traefik, or a cloud load balancer, skip the `tls`
profile entirely — `docker compose up -d` keeps the coordinator on
`127.0.0.1:8000` and you point your proxy at it.

Two things your proxy must do:

- **forward WebSocket upgrades.** The agent fleet holds a long-lived socket on
  `/ws/…`. On nginx that means `proxy_set_header Upgrade`/`Connection`, and
  `proxy_read_timeout 300s` — without the timeout, nginx silently drops healthy
  agents after 60 seconds.
- **set `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`.**

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout 300s;
}
```

Then set in `.env`, by hand:

```ini
ENVIRONMENT=production
WRIT_PUBLIC_URL=https://writ.example.com
CORS_ORIGINS=https://writ.example.com
FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=127.0.0.1
```

`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` must name the address your proxy connects **from**. Get it
wrong and every request looks like it came from the proxy: all clients share one
rate-limit bucket, one attacker's failed logins lock out everyone, and your audit
log records the proxy's IP instead of the caller's.

## Hostnames

You do **not** need `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. `WRIT_PUBLIC_URL`'s hostname is trusted
automatically, and so is loopback (the container healthcheck curls
`localhost:8000` from inside the container).

Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` only for *extra* names this coordinator also answers on — a
vanity alias, a second hostname, a wildcard like `*.team.example.com`. You can
also edit them under **Settings → Network → Trusted hosts**, which applies
without a restart and shows you the effective list.

A request whose `Host` header is not on the list gets a 400 naming the rejected
hostname and how to fix it.

## Rate limiting

Three layers, on by default:

- **Per-IP ceiling across everything.** `GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` requests per
  `GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` seconds — 600/60 by default. Static assets, the
  healthcheck and CORS preflights are exempt. Generous on purpose: it is a DoS
  backstop, not a quota, and one browser tab loading the app already spends tens
  of requests a minute. Set `GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false` if a WAF in front
  already does this.
- **Per-path limits** on the paths that matter: login and password reset have
  brute-force lockout on both the IP and the account, agent pairing codes are
  single-use and rate-limited, inbound webhooks are capped.
- **Automatic IP bans** for hosts that keep failing authentication.

Behind a proxy, all three depend on `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` being right.

## Backups

Everything lives on the `writ-data` volume: the SQLite database and your files.

Back up **`SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `.env` separately, and somewhere other
than this server.** It encrypts stored credentials at rest — a database backup
without it cannot decrypt them, and there is no recovery path.

## Document extraction across a network

The `doc-extract` service ships in this bundle and starts with everything else,
so PDFs, office documents and scanned pages work with no configuration — **as
long as your agents run on the same host as the coordinator.**

The reason is worth understanding, because the failure is silent: agents call
doc-extract *directly*, with bytes they already fetched. The coordinator never
calls it. The address handed to each agent defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8092`,
which is right for a co-located agent and unreachable for one elsewhere. An agent
that cannot reach the service does not error — it skips non-HTML content exactly
as if the service were absent.

So if any agent runs on another machine:

1. Set `WRIT_DOC_EXTRACT_DOMAIN=docs.writ.example.com` in `.env` and point that
   name at this server. The bundled Caddy already has a site block for it and
   will get it a certificate.
2. Set `DOC_EXTRACT_URL=https://docs.writ.example.com` so agents are handed the
   routable address.
3. Leave `DOC_EXTRACT_SECRET` as generated. Once the service is reachable over a
   network that secret is the only thing in front of it, so never expose it
   without one and never publish port 8092 on a public interface.

`GET /api/fleet/connect-info` reports `doc_extract.enabled` and the URL agents
are being handed. To turn the lane off entirely, set `DOC_EXTRACT_URL=` (empty)
and run `docker compose up -d coordinator` on its own.
